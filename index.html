                recommended to learn about development skills will give you the foundation and logic for communicating
                with programming laguages.</p>

            <p>
                Communities are usuallay built on shared struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and
                the goals of each community differ per the individual's collective needs.If you want to grow as a
                developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community.There are many
                advantages,from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support, shsring tools, code
                reviews, answering questions and much more.

            <p>No child should be working.Every child has the right to a good education, the right to play
                and
                enjoy it's childhood.Child labour means that poverty continues to exist.Eradicating child
                labour means development and better opportunities for everyone.
